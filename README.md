# factorial puzzle

CAVEATE: Older project!!! Does not reflect current coding style/conventions!

Based on this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAPNzzeNWZg

Brute force solves abc = a! + b! + c!

Also extensible functions to solve
abcd....(n digits)..xyz = a! + b! + c! + d! + ...(n digits) ... + x! + y! + z!

using both leading 0s and not allowing them.
